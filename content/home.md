I work at [Simile](https://simile.ai/).

Before this, I went to Stanford and got my bachelor's and master's in computer science. During that time, I did engineering at [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), published [ML research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9SLlqYkAAAAJ&hl=en), and got [involved](https://www.tcv.com/) [with](https://academy.unusual.vc/) [startups](https://stanford.edu/class/cs210/index.html).

I'm originally from Frederick, MD.
