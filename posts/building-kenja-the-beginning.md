excerpt: "The story of how Kenja started and our initial vision for the project."

Every project has its origin story, and Kenja is no different. What started as a simple idea to improve how we interact with information has evolved into something much more ambitious.

## The Genesis

The idea for Kenja came from a simple observation: despite having access to more information than ever before, finding exactly what we need when we need it remains surprisingly difficult. We wanted to change that.

## Initial Goals

Our initial goals were straightforward:

- Create a more intuitive way to search through information
- Develop a system that learns from user interactions
- Build something that could scale with growing information needs
