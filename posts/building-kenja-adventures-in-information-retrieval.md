Information retrieval (IR) is a fascinating field that combines elements of computer science, linguistics, and cognitive psychology. In this post, I'll share my experience building Kenja, an IR system designed to make information discovery more intuitive and efficient.

## The Challenge

When we started building Kenja, we faced several key challenges:

- How to effectively index and search through large amounts of unstructured data
- Creating a ranking system that truly understands user intent
- Balancing precision and recall in search results

## Our Approach

We decided to implement a hybrid approach combining traditional IR techniques with modern machine learning methods. This included:

- Vector space modeling for document representation
- BERT-based semantic search
- Custom ranking algorithms
