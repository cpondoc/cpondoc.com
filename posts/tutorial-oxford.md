In this tutorial, we'll build a machine learning model that can detect whether a sentence uses the Oxford comma. This is a fun way to explore natural language processing while solving a real (if somewhat niche) problem.

## What is the Oxford Comma?

The Oxford comma, also known as the serial comma, is the comma used before the conjunction (usually "and" or "or") in a list of three or more items. For example:

- With Oxford comma: "I love cats, dogs, and birds"
- Without Oxford comma: "I love cats, dogs and birds"

## Building the Detector

Our approach will involve:

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Feature extraction using spaCy
- Training a simple classifier
- Evaluating the results
